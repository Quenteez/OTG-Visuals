##  OTG-Visuals for OpenTerrainGenerator

OTG-Visuals is a mod developed for Minecraft 1.16.5 on the Fabric platform. Its main goal is to enrich the visual aspects of the game exclusively on the client side. Meanwhile, on the server side, the official OpenTerrainGenerator plugin for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper is responsible for generating the world and sending packages with effects to the mod.

Traditionally, Open Terrain Generator was available exclusively on two platforms: Forge and Spigot. However, there has been a noticeable trend pushing the community to switch to Fabric because of its performance. Realizing this shift, I embarked on a mission to include some OTG features in this mod.

The goal behind this endeavor was to allow players to play on a modified Fabric client, and at the same time see the effects of biomes provided by the creators of the servers.
